# Album Demo App
This is a frontend part of Album Demo App project. It was part of a udemy course ([Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-java-developer-java/)) and it is further developed for learning purposes. It is meant as a demo, but mainly it is a way to learn and practice modern coding. 

## Deployment
The app is currently deployed on render.com, specifically on [this website](https://albumsapp-qgrt.onrender.com/). For anyone who wants to try it, here are some notes:
- It allows users to create albums and upload photos, but it is not meant to be a permanent storage. That means that every time render redeploys the app, all photos are deleted.
- It uses free deployment plan, which means the app (specifically the backend) is not permanently running and ready. It is possible that it will take about a minute for the app to start working. After that, it should run normally. 
- It is a learning project. It is still far from finished with many improvments still in plan. That means it might not work perfectly, the user experience might not be ideal etc. It is also possible that the app might not work at all, because of some changes, deployments etc. It is my first deployed project, so thank you for understanding.
